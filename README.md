# Eye-controlled-mouse-using-python-Project
In the fast-evolving landscape of technology, the quest for more intuitive and efficient
humancomputer interactionmethods is ever-present. "EyeMouse" represents a groundbreaking
project aimed at implementing mouse functionality using eye movement, pushing the boundaries of
conventional input devices and opening new avenues for accessibility and user experience.The
primary goal of the EyeMouse project is to create a novel and accessible means of interacting with
computers by harnessing the power of eye-tracking technology. By translating the subtle nuances
of eye movements into precise cursor control and clicking actions, EyeMouse seeks to redefine the
way users navigate and engage with digital interfaces.
